# DEPRECATED
For various reasons RDP Application launching for web applications based on AutoIT has been deprecated.

The primary suggestion is to use the Go-based implementation: https://github.com/OneIdentity/SafeguardAutomation/tree/master/RDP%20Applications/Go%20chromedp

In case you need to inject credentials into web applications accessed through Firefox, the AutoIT code could be ported e.g. to C# and Selenium, or other preferred method.
